#Update Your GitHub Page - Module 

Instructions
Using the concepts we've covered in this module, make the following updates to your Resume repo that you've hosted using GitHub Pages.

Create a new html page called projects.html.
Your projects page should showcase at least three projects from your GitHub profile. The project should have a name (this can be the repo name) that links to the project repository. Each project should have a short description.
In index.html create a link to your projects page.
Add CSS styling to both pages that is consistent. DO NOT add your CSS to the html files. All styles must be within a linked CSS file.
Remove any styling you may have within index.html.
