                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Francesca Mercado. 
                    I have climbed my way up from Customer Service to now managing my own Branch at our local DMV.
                    I have a passion for learning and have excelled in all the work positions that I had.
                    I am confident that I will be a great addition to any company that I work for due to my resilience.
